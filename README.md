# CTEQ2024 MC Tutorial, August 2024

## Session 1 - Thursday, Friday

The purpose of this session is to introduce essential tools for making predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Through a series of simple examples, you will learn the basics of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including how to generate events, store them, and analyse the results using a standard analysis toolchain. 

The learning materials can be found in [Session 1 Examples](session1_examples.md). This document contains basic instructions along with several examples. We will go through the material together; the examples will be discussed first and then demonstrated. You're expected to try the examples right away, but don't worry if you fall behind. We've allocated plenty of time for everyone to work through the exercises in tomorrow's session.

Your experience may vary significantly, and for those of you with extensive experience, weâ€™ve also prepared a simple assignment that will be linked here. You can work on it independently.

## Session 2 - Sunday

The content of Session 2 will be linked here.
